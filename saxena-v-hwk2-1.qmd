\noindent 1. Here is the line graph with the number of hospitals filing multiple reports per year
```{r}

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate, readr, readxl, hrbrthemes, fixest,
               scales, gganimate, gapminder, gifski, png, tufte, plotly, OECD,
               ggrepel, survey, foreign, devtools, pdftools, kableExtra, modelsummary,
               kableExtra)

library(knitr)


load("Hwk2_workspace.Rdata")

ggplot(num_hospitals_multiple_reports, aes(x = year, y = num_hospitals)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Hospitals", title = "Number of Hospitals with Multiple Reports")
```

\noindent 10. I had a difficult time reading in the data and getting it all to download, so I was only able to get through question 1. I also have no experience with R outside of Homework 1, so figuring out how the ggplots work in conjunction with Quarto is an ongoing learning process.
